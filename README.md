# Sales-Analyzing-Power-BI-Dashboard

This is a Power BI fully interactive Dashboard! 📊

• I made it with the help of a large Microsoft Excel hypothetical data of approximatley 4117 columns that contained various data about different customers with their unique order IDs. Made for SN Corporation that lies in E-commerce industry just like flipkart, amazon, myntra, etc. 

• We have to analyse the number of sales per year, monthly, quarterly sold, the profit gained by different regions of the world and the sum of costs of products and also their shipping modes for this company.

• Learned how to make it look more presentable and good by applying different font colours, visual borders and background colours.

Looking forward to explore more on Data Analysis!
